# This wiki covers the 1516B robot.


Team 1516B is a <span style="color: skyblue;">Vex VRC</span> team based out of San Ramon, California. In this wiki, we try to explain the workings of our robot and how they were implemented and decided upon from a high-level perspective. This wiki resembles the extremely well made [BLRS Wiki](https://wiki.purduesigbots.com/). Purdue SIGbots has made that wiki as a knowledge base for information about robotics and about the VEX ecosystem, while this wiki tries to take a more simple approach by focusing on describing our robot and its workings only.
