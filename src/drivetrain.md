# Drivetrain

Currently, Team 1516B uses a <span style="color: aquamarine">6 motor</span> drivetrain with omniwheels for fast movement, and also uses gear ratios optimized for speed on the drivetrain. We aim for a <span style="color: cadetblue;">fast drivetrain</span> that can move the robot around and push triballs as well as one that has enough torque to overcome an <span style="color: darkred;">opposing robot</span> pushing ours backwards.

We put 4 motors in the back in order to save space in the middle for a triball holding area. As we have defined the game, [Over Under](https://www.vexrobotics.com/over-under-manual), this year as a "pushing game", our intake serves moderately little use except as a holder for our beginning autonomous. Therefore, our drivetrain must be one of the <span style="color: blueviolet;">strongest portions</span> of our robot.
