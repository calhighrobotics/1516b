The vast majority of our codebase and project structure remains the same between the Over Under season and the High Stakes season, at least at the beginning of the season. We have chosen to implement _changes to our programming approach instead of major project changes._

What does that mean? Last year, we explored the area of advanced VEX programming, dabbling into the PROS framework for the first time in several years, implementing PID's, and going for a more ambitious autonomous routine than ever before. As programmers, we likened this to year 0, where we learned about these subjects. 

Year 1, the High Stakes, will have us build upon what we learned last year, fleshing out even more ambitious autonomi, upgrading to PROS 4, and implementing a full-fledged GUI on the vex brain such that issues are provided in the most clear way to all times. An example of this is having an accessible autonomous selector, as well as graphs describing the robot's odometry during the driver period, both of which are planned additions to the codebase. Additionally, we plan to apply our knowledge of control theory to our codebase as well.
