# Lift

## Semester 1
We did not use a lift for the majority of the first semster, but did use a blocker which was activated by a piston

## Semester 2
In our second semester, we decided to combine both our system to shoot match loads over blockers from other teams as well as to block other teams. We decided to complete this task by building a [4-bar](https://wiki.purduesigbots.com/hardware/lifts/four-bar) lift that would help us gain the height to complete both of these functions relatively easily. To see the principle of how a 4 bar is built and works, see the link given beforehand. In general, a 4-bar lift looks like the following, with the further end buing pulled upwards.

Our four bar houses the [PTO system](./pto.md) in the rear side as well as the power transfer mechanisms for the lift/[shooter](./shooter.md) and the [intake](./intake.md). The middle contains the power transfer gears to run the [shooter](./shooter.md) and the very end of the four-bar contains the flywheel itself. The 4-bar lift is also powered by a certain pneumatic setting to redirect power from the PTO to the 4-bar, that will help lift and bring down the 4-bar. It uses a ratchet to keep the 4-bar up when shooting/blocking, to keep it from falling back down.
