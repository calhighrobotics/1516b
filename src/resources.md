[BLRS Wiki](https://wiki.purduesigbots.com/) - This is the BLRS wiki. It contains a lot of information on engineering, building, and many other things, and comes from the creator of PROS, Purdue SIGbots. Here is a relevant [Vex Forum link](https://www.vexforum.com/t/purdue-sigbots-robotics-knowledgebase-wiki/81576).  

Additionally, some other knowledge wiki-like information that was found are:

- [7842F Explanation](https://www.vexforum.com/t/7842f-2018-19-robot-showcase-flywheel-control-odometry-engineering-journals-more/65170) - This is an explanation of the strategies used by a team to gain success. They have an advanced codebase, and it would be benificial to learn from their experiences.
