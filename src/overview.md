# About the Wiki


Team 1516B is a <span style="color: skyblue;">Vex VRC</span> team based out of San Ramon, California. In this wiki, we try to explain the <span style="color: seagreen;">workings of our robot</span> and how they were implemented and decided upon from a <span style="color: tan;">high level perspective</span>. This wiki resembles the extremely well made [BLRS Wiki](https://wiki.purduesigbots.com/). Purdue SIGbots has made that wiki as a knowledge base for information about robotics and about the <span style="color: lightcoral;">VEX ecosystem</span>, while this wiki tries to take a more simple approach by focusing on describing our robot and its workings only, to give an example rather than to teach.
